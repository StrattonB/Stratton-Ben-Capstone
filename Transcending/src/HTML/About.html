        <p class="about-Ben">
            As a transgender man, I have first-hand experience dealing with medical and legal issues surrounding the transgender community. I have also personally been faced with discrimination. It is because of my struggles, that the idea of Transcending was born.
            It is my mission to help other people overcome the struggles that I have had and to provide education for others so that future generations will not have the same issues.<br>- Ben<br> Founder/CEO
